                <p class="mb-5">Along my journey, as a software developer, I have learned many useful languages such as
                    javascript, Node.js, And data languages such as MySQL and mongooseDB as well as many others I am proud to
                    demonstrate these
                    skills below. In the ocean that is software development, I am excited to explore and learn any language that
                    can play an important role in your company. I am a team player that loves to communicate with other
                    developers about new strategies, languages, and opportunities to grow as a vital role in any project. The work
                    I
                    have put into this journey has been immense and extremely
                    rewarding and I look forward to playing my role in the next generation of development. </p>
