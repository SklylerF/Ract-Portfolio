                <p>Apart from being a web developer, I consider myself a rugged outdoorsman with many personal accomplishments
                    in climbing indoor and outdoor, hiking peaks, and backpacking. I have traveled to very remote locations and
                    survived several natural disasters along the way, but nothing has stopped my journey to see the world and
                    experience nature in any state.</p>
